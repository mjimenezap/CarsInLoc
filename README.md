This repository contains both the Jupyter Notebooks that I made for the capstone projects and the reports and documentation that I submitted in order to pass the course. 

The Jupyter Notebooks are divided in 5 different sections: 
- Data exploration
- ETL
- Feature Engineering
- Model definition and Training
- Model evaluation

The documentation emcompases several documents: 
- The ADD with key architectural decisions
- A really short report of the project
- Some slides that I did for the presentation
- The presentation in video format
- The diploma
- A cool badge
